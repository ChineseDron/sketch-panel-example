# Example of Custom Panels in Sketch

This is an example Sketch plugin to demonstrate how to add a custom panel (NSView) to Sketch similar to Craft by Invision or Auto-Layout by Anima without having to write your own Objective-C package.

This example demonstrates:
1. Showing / hiding the panel
2. Updating the panel based on the current selection
3. Adding an action to the panel that does something based on the current selection
4. Automatically opening the panel based on its state from the last document the user had open.
